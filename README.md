# rust-with-web-interface-
It's a pretty simple application, since I'm just starting to learn rust. 
You are running a local server with port 3000 , it does not touch any system ports , so you do not need administrator mode . 
This application has two main functions :
*Login , check if this user exists in the database . 
*Second registration, you can check if the username exists, check if the re-entry password is correct and also enter new data in the database.

i use :
1)iron 
2)mime
3)router
4)urlencoded
5)sqlite
